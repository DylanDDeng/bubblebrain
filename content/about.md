Welcome to BubbleBrain 🫧

This is a space where I document my explorations and reflections on technology, focusing on:

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) and large-scale models  
- Software engineering and programming practices  
- Product design and engineering efficiency  
- Learning methodologies and ways of thinking  

The site is built with Hugo + PaperMod, statically hosted for speed and readability. Here you can:

- Browse my summaries of cutting-edge tech and engineering practices  
- Quickly locate topics of interest through categories and search  
- Join discussions and leave feedback via Giscus at the bottom of each post
