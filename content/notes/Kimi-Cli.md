[Moonshot AI](https://x.com/Kimi_Moonshot) has open-sourced its own coding agent, [kimi-cli](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli?tab=readme-ov-file).  

Built in Python, the codebase is approachable for anyone who wants to learn how agents are engineered. A single monthly subscription—bought on the official site—grants credits for both the web product and the CLI.  

I used this coding agent to fix several bugs on my personal site and each was resolved on the first pass.
