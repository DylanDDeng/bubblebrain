Kuaishou recently refreshed its New Coding Model lineup with two releases: **KAT-Coder-Pro V1** and **KAT-Coder-Air V1**.

Both variants integrate smoothly with leading coding-agent tools such as Claude Code, Cline, and Kilo.

I ran the Pro model inside Claude Code, and the onboarding experience was straightforward.

Below is the Claude Code configuration I used:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="https://wanqing.streamlakeapi.com/api/gateway/v1/endpoints/ep-xxx-xxx/claude-code-proxy"
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN="YOUR_WANQING_API_KEY"
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="KAT-Coder"
export ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL="KAT-Coder-Air-V1"
```

API keys are available via the [Kuaishou Wanqing](https://www.streamlake.com) console.

For a quick benchmark, I reran my usual SVG generation test (the Xbox controller graphic). Output quality is still behind other models, so there is room for improvement.
